      <li>Just plain tennis balls. He will play fetch with those till the end of time</li>
      <li>I would like to say me, but it would probably be the one who feeds him the most (my mom)</li>
      <li>He will just sit there and stare at them. When they finally get the memo he will get up and lead them to what he needs (e.g to the back door to go outside, or to his water bowl to refill it).</li>
